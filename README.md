# Frontend Homework 27

I have finished my twenty-seventh homework.

This was the first Angular homework.

So far Angular seems very fast and easy to write, 
but it feels a bit confusing because of all the different files.

Still have to do styling, but committed the repository already,
just in case I'm too busy sending job applications tomorrow and forget to do it.
